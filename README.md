Nosferatu Awakening

This game was submitted to LaSalle College as a Final Project for the students:

- Aaron Cruz
- Briano Adams
- Santiago Alvarez Cardenas
- Kevin Charron

The game is created to be a 2.5D platformer. It has inspiration from Castlevania. 
The main character is a vampire that awoke from his coffin to find out that his castle was invaded. He then exterminates them and tries to go to the outside world.

The vampire in question wields a whip and has the ability to manipulate objects around him.

At the current stage, the game has a few levels, in which you need to traverse and fight a boss at the end. It has functionality to save and load data locally or from a server.
